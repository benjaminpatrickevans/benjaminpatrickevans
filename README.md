### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Im a current PhD student at The University of Sydney working on economic decision making and the emergence of complex non-linearities from simple individual agent decisions (specifically within housing markets).

Previously I completed my MSc in Machine Learning at Victoria University of Wellington.

My research lies at the intersection of Complexity and Machine Learning. I am particulatly interested in bounded rationality and heuristic search.
