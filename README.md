### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I work on multi-agent systems, mainly with applications in market modelling.

I completed my PhD in Computer Science as part of the Modelling and Simulation group at the University of Sydney, and my MSc and BSc (Hons) in Computer Science at Victoria University of Wellington as part of the Evolutionary Computation and Machine Learning group.
