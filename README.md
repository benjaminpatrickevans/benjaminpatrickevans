### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Im a current PhD student at The University of Sydney working on decision making and the emergence of complex non-linearities from simple individual agent decisions.  I am particularly interested in bounded rationality and heuristic search.

Previously I completed my MSc in Machine Learning at Victoria University of Wellington. My research lies at the intersection of Complexity and Machine Learning, and I am particularly interested in applications within Economics and Finance.
